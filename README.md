# Pacman-multy-agent
## About :thought_balloon:
My contribution for this project can be found in the following class: multiAgents.py. Using the framework provided I implemented some algorithms such as Minimax and Alpha-Beta-Prunning.
## Features :white_check_mark:
- Pacman will win the game 90% of the time.
- The game has a nice interface.
